# Snake_game

This is a simple Snake Game implemented in Python using the Turtle module.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script `main.py`.
2. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.
3. The snake will grow longer each time it eats food.
4. Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body.
5. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.
